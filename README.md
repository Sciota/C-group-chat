# C-group-chat

A simple group chat made in C, the server source is incomplete, it contains some logical errors that i will fix.
I really like this project cause i implemented for the first time threads and structs in a cool fashioned way :D

I know, it sucks.

# compile

compile with:

	gcc chat_server.c -o server -pthread
	gcc chat_client.c -o client -pthread
